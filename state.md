# State — Sword-jin_PWA (SwordJin)

*Tracked. Updated at session close. What changed, what's pending, what's blocked.*

## Current state
- Head: `bac0e0b` (chore/pck-size-reduction)
- Tests: GUT unit tests — 15 tests, 26 assertions, all passing
- Smoke test: 30/30 chapters, no script errors
- Lint: `gdformat --check . && gdlint .` — PASS (binding in CI)
- .pck size: 29 MB (was 111 MB)
- Last updated: 2026-07-23

## Session 2026-07-23 — .pck size reduction (Task 3.3)

### Completed
- **Task 3.3**: Reduced .pck from 111 MB to 29 MB (74% reduction, well under 80 MB target)
  - Set texture import default to lossy compression (`compress/mode=1`) in `project.godot` `[import_defaults]` — imported textures dropped from ~80 MB (uncompressed RGBA) to ~9 MB (lossy-compressed)
  - Removed 52 unreferenced SFX .wav files (not referenced in any .gd or .tscn)
  - Re-encoded all 17 BGM .ogg files at 64kbps (local-only, assets/bgm/ is gitignored)
  - Converted `theme01_ambience.wav` (1.3 MB) to `.ogg` (36 KB)
  - Export preset: `vram_texture_compression/for_mobile=true` (local-only, not in git diff since export_presets.cfg was reverted — VRAM compression requires S3TC ASTC support at export time that fails in CI headless; lossy compress/mode=1 achieves the goal without VRAM export flags)

### .pck size audit
- Before: 111 MB (uncompressed RGBA textures ~80 MB, BGM ~32 MB at 120kbps, SFX ~2.8 MB, voice ~0.9 MB)
- After: 29 MB (lossy-compressed textures ~9 MB, BGM ~14 MB at 64kbps, SFX ~1.4 MB, voice ~0.9 MB)
- Top contributors to original size:
  - Textures: 1166 .webp/.png files, all stored uncompressed (compress/mode=0) → now lossy (compress/mode=1)
  - BGM: 17 .ogg files at ~120kbps → re-encoded to 64kbps
  - SFX: 74 .wav files, 52 unreferenced → removed
  - theme01_ambience.wav: 1.3 MB uncompressed WAV → converted to 36 KB .ogg

## Session 2026-07-22 — CI quality, docs, tests, PlayFab, save encryption

### Completed tasks
- **Task 0.1**: FF `main` to `2842be6`, synced `dev`, deleted `fix/smoke-driver-victory-detection` branch
- **Task 1.1**: Consolidated two deploy workflows into single `ci.yml` (deleted `deploy.yml`, added `workflow_dispatch`)
- **Task 1.2**: Made lint gating binding — removed `|| true`, added `gdlintrc` with tuned rule overrides, formatted all GDScript files
- **Task 1.3**: Wrote ADR-004 (smoke driver) and ADR-005 (PlayFab persistence)
- **Task 2.1**: Vendored GUT 9.3.0, wrote 5 test files (15 tests, 26 asserts) covering combat math, save migration, PlayFab login_failed, save encryption
- **Task 2.2**: Wrote `docs/testing/offline-mobile-checklist.md` (manual device testing, not automatable in CI)
- **Task 2.3**: Raised Lighthouse PWA threshold to 0.9 fatal with 3G throttling
- **Task 3.1**: Wired `PlayFab.login_failed` to `ErrorScreen.show_error()` in `playfab.gd:_ready()`
- **Task 3.2**: Added XOR-keystream save encryption with per-install key (`user://swordjin_save.key`), envelope versioning `{"enc": 1, "data": "..."}`, legacy plaintext migration
- ADR-006: Documented save encryption decision

### Pending
- **Task 3.3** (.pck size reduction): 116 MB → < 80 MB target requires asset audit (32 MB BGM, 77 MB textures in import cache). Not completed this session.
- **Task 2.2** (real-device offline test): Manual testing on Android/iOS not completed this session. Checklist exists.
- Lighthouse PWA 0.9 threshold: needs CI verification (may fail on throttled run if PWA score < 0.9 — fix the PWA, don't lower the threshold)

## P0 fix — smoke driver victory-screen detection (2026-07-22)

### Root cause
The smoke driver relied solely on VictoryScreen visibility (`scene.get_node_or_null("Main/VictoryScreen").visible`) to detect chapter completion. In CI's headless environment, VictoryScreen detection could fail if:
1. The `Main/VictoryScreen` node path didn't resolve (instanced scene edge case)
2. `show_victory()` crashed before setting `visible = true` (missing textures in headless)
3. `CanvasLayer.visible` was `false` despite `show_victory()` being called

After chapter completion via `LevelManager._finish_chapter_complete()`, `GameState.complete_current_chapter()` updates `GameState.completed_chapters` *before* `show_victory()`. The driver never checked GameState, so it reported 0/30.

### Fix
- Added `_last_completed_count` tracking `GameState.completed_chapters.size()` as a fallback detection path
- Added `_advancing` guard at top of `_process` to prevent double-reporting (after `_advance_to_next_chapter()` changes ChapterDatabase, subsequent ticks would re-enter with wrong chapter ID)
- Made `_get_victory_screen()` try `find_child("VictoryScreen", true, false)` as fallback when `Main/VictoryScreen` path fails
- Extracted `_try_chapter_complete()`, `_advance_dialogue()`, `_heal_and_fight()` from `_process` to satisfy gdlint max-returns rule

# Asset Generation State

> Session checkpoint: 2026-06-20
> Last action: second major batch completed; two scripts created but not yet run.

## Project
Swordjin — Godot 4.4.1 GL Compatibility mobile PWA, 640×360.

## Refreshed audit — 2026-07-17 (uncommitted tree)
- **Smoke driver expanded to all 30 chapters.** `scripts/ci/headless_smoke_driver.gd` (new, untracked) now iterates ch001→ch030 via `ChapterDatabase.set_current_chapter(next_id)` + scene reload, quits 0 on full run, quits 1 on missing next chapter. `scripts/ci/smoke_test.sh` (modified) asserts `COMPLETED == 30` and greps for `"All 30 chapters complete"`; timeout raised 60→300s. CI `build` job runs it (timeout-minutes: 2 — **likely too tight for 30 chapters**, see risk below).
- **Lint step rewritten.** `ci.yml` lint job drops the always-skipping `if command -v godot --check-only` path; now `pip install gdtoolkit` + `gdformat --check` + `gdlint`. Both still `|| true` → **non-fatal** (lint remains advisory, but no longer skips).
- **Node 24 pinned in lighthouse job.** `ci.yml` lighthouse job now uses `actions/setup-node@v4` with `node-version: '24'` (was relying on runner default Node for `npx @lhci/cli`). Uncommitted.
- **Pages deploy is live.** `ci.yml` has `deploy` job (configure-pages@v5 enablement, deploy-pages@v4) + standalone `deploy.yml` workflow. Last commit `44d0fd3` "trigger fresh Pages deploy after enablement". Gap #3 is **FIXED** (state.md still says STILL-OPEN — stale).
- **PlayFab pending-queue persisted.** `playfab.gd:246` `SAVE_PATH="user://playfab_state.json"`, `_save_state()` (line 277) writes `_pending_submits`, `_load_state()` restores. Gap #13 is **FIXED** (state.md still says STILL-OPEN — stale).
- **Test coverage status.** Still no `test_*.gd` unit tests (gap #5 stays open as a unit-test gap), but the headless smoke driver now exercises all 30 chapters end-to-end — call it PARTIAL (integration covered, unit math/save-migration untested).
- **Lint gap #9.** Was "PARTIAL — skips because godot not installed"; now "PARTIAL-improved — gdtoolkit runs but `|| true` non-fatal".
- **ADRs.** Still 3 (ADR-001 Godot 4, ADR-002 PWA, ADR-003 MiniMax assets), all dated 2026-05, still accurate but stale. No ADRs added for smoke driver, save migration, PlayFab persistence, daily challenge, etc.
- **Remaining open:** #5 (unit tests), #6 (manual device offline test), #7 (PlayFab login_failed still signal-only), #9 (lint non-fatal), #19 (plaintext saves), #20 (no cloud save), #21 (no analytics).
- **New risk not in gap list:** `build` job's `timeout-minutes: 2` on the smoke step is almost certainly too short for a 30-chapter headless run (driver uses 0.2s ticks + 0.5s fades per chapter → ~30s minimum, plus scene reloads/import). 300s shell `timeout` is fine, but the GH job `timeout-minutes: 2` will kill the job before that. Raise to ≥6.

## Risk flag
- `ci.yml:94` `timeout-minutes: 2` on the 30-chapter smoke step — bump to 6+ or the Pages deploy will start failing once the smoke driver actually walks all 30 chapters.

## Pipeline conventions
- Images: MiniMax `image-01` API → Pillow post-process (`fit_square` for 1:1, `resize_with_letterbox` for 16:9) → `.webp` quality 85, method 6.
- Music: MiniMax `music-2.6` API → download MP3 → ffmpeg `-c:a libvorbis -q:a 4` → `.ogg`.
- SFX: procedural Python (`wave`/`struct`/`math`) → mono 22050 Hz 16-bit `.wav`.
- API key loaded from `/home/kirk/Madlab/Lockdown/.minimax`.
- All generation scripts use skip-existing logic to support resume/retry.

## Gap Audit — verified 2026-07-03

### 1. HTML5 Export Artifacts Missing — FIXED
builds/web/ now contains index.html, index.wasm, index.pck, index.js, index.audio.worklet.js; CI build job runs `--export-release "HTML5"` and verifies artifacts exist.

### 2. Service Worker Cache List Hardcoded — FIXED
sw.js is auto-generated by patch_pwa.sh scanning actual export files; ASSETS_TO_CACHE lists real filenames (index.wasm, index.pck, etc.).

### 3. No Hosting Infrastructure — STILL-OPEN
.github/workflows/ci.yml has no deploy job (no Pages/Vercel/Netlify/Cloudflare step); grep for deploy/pages/peaceiris returns nothing.

### 4. PlayFab Title ID Hardcoded — FIXED
scripts/autoload/playfab.gd:21 `var TITLE_ID = ProjectSettings.get_setting("playfab/title_id", "")`.

### 5. Zero Test Coverage — STILL-OPEN
No test_*.gd files found; CI has no `godot --run-tests` step.

### 6. PWA Offline Mode Never Validated — PARTIAL
Lighthouse CI step added (lighthouserc.json, PWA threshold 0.8); manual offline test on physical Android/iOS still undocumented.

### 7. No User-Facing Error UI — PARTIAL
scripts/error_screen.gd + scenes/error_screen.tscn exist; chapter_database.gd:47,59 and level_manager.gd:57 wired to ErrorScreen.show_error; playfab.gd login_failed (line 211) still only emits signal, no ErrorScreen call.

### 8. No offline.html Fallback — FIXED
builds/web/offline.html exists; sw.js fetch catch serves caches.match('/offline.html') for navigate requests.

### 9. No CI GDScript Linting or Build Validation — PARTIAL
CI build job runs HTML5 export + artifact verification (catches parse errors); dedicated GDScript `--check-only` lint step in lint job is wrapped in `if command -v godot` but godot not installed in lint job, so it skips.

### 10. FS.syncfs() Save Persistence Unverified — FIXED
game_state.gd:843-861 `_save_indexeddb` now documents the syncfs→IndexedDB path and DevTools verification steps (Application → IndexedDB → /home/web_user/...); called from save_game (line 644) and autosave tick.

### 11. No Install Prompt UI — FIXED
builds/web/index.html:96 has beforeinstallprompt bridge; scripts/title_screen.gd:21 InstallAppButton + _on_install_app_pressed:308.

### 12. Cache Version Manual Bump — FIXED
sw.js CACHE_NAME = 'swordjin-4b6a11f3' (md5 of .pck); patch_pwa.sh generates from `md5sum "$PCK_FILE" | cut -c1-8`.

### 13. PlayFab Score Queue Lost on Refresh — STILL-OPEN
playfab.gd:31 `_pending_submits: Array = []` is in-memory only; no persistence to save file.

### 14. Save File Format No Migration Path — FIXED
game_state.gd:585 `_migrate_save(data: Dictionary)` function, called at line 670 on load.

### 15. Nightly Build Script Ignores Export Exit Codes — FIXED
scripts/nightly_dev.sh:194 `timeout 120 godot ... || { echo "[NIGHTLY] Export failed — aborting"; exit 1; }`.

### 16. No CHANGELOG — FIXED
CHANGELOG.md exists.

### 17. No Setup Guide — FIXED
CONTRIBUTING.md exists.

### 18. Push Notification Subscription Dead Code — FIXED
Auto-generated sw.js has no push/subscription listener (dead code removed).

### 19. Save File Plaintext — STILL-OPEN
game_state.gd save_game uses `file.store_string(JSON.stringify(data, "\t"))`; no encryption/XOR/Web Crypto.

### 20. No Cloud Save — STILL-OPEN
No UpdateUserData/GetUserData in playfab.gd; PlayFab not wired for save data.

### 21. No Analytics or Crash Reporting — STILL-OPEN
No analytics beacon / Plausible / telemetry in scripts/ or builds/web/.

### 22. No License File — FIXED
LICENSE exists.

### 23. Colorblind Mode Not Implemented — FIXED
scripts/damage_number.gd:14-24 `_colorblind_prefix()` prepends shape symbols (✚ heal / ✶ damage / ◆ special / ★ crit) when GameState.settings.colorblind_mode is on; toggle wired in settings_screen.gd:12,45,73,113-115 and scenes/ui/settings_screen.tscn (ColorblindMode node); setting persisted in game_state.gd:64.

### 24. Leaderboard Pending Scores Not Rate-Limited — FIXED
playfab.gd:32-35 adds PENDING_FLUSH_INTERVAL=0.25s; _handle_login (line 202-209) now awaits get_tree().create_timer between flush iterations so a backlog trickles instead of bursting. HTTP layer still serializes one request at a time.

### Fixes applied 2026-07-03
Quick mechanical fixes this run (smallest working diff, no new deps, no behavior redesign):
- #10 FS.syncfs — added docblock to `_save_indexeddb` documenting the IndexedDB persistence path and DevTools verification steps. No runtime change.
- #23 colorblind — added `colorblind_mode` setting (game_state.gd), settings-screen toggle (settings_screen.gd + .tscn), and shape-symbol prefixes in damage_number.gd (✚/✶/◆/★). Additive only; off by default, no visual change for default users.
- #24 pending-score rate limit — added 0.25s `PENDING_FLUSH_INTERVAL` cooldown between pending-submit flush iterations in playfab.gd `_handle_login`. HTTP serialization unchanged.

Deferred this run (NOT 10-20 min mechanical fixes):
- #3 hosting/deploy — needs deployment target/credentials (deferred: needs infra decision).
- #5 tests — real test suite is not a quick fix (deferred: needs scope/effort decision).
- #13 pending-queue persistence — _save_state() exists but isn't called when a score is queued; wiring it is a 1-line change but changes persistence behavior, so deferred as a candidate for manual verification.
- #19 save encryption — crypto/trust-boundary change (deferred).
- #20 cloud save — needs PlayFab UpdateUserData/GetUserData wiring + backend (deferred).
- #21 analytics — needs provider selection (deferred).
- #6 PWA offline — manual physical-device test still undocumented (deferred: needs device).
- #7 user-facing error UI — playfab.gd login_failed still only emits signal; wiring ErrorScreen is small but changes runtime behavior (deferred as candidate).
- #9 CI GDScript lint — lint job skips because godot not installed in lint job (deferred: CI infra change).

Checks run: `godot --headless --path . --quit` (full project parse, autoloads registered) — exit 0, no script errors, project boots cleanly. CI's `--check-only --script` mode reports pre-existing "Identifier not found" errors for autoload names (AudioManager/PlayFab/GameState) in both edited and unedited files — that is a known limitation of that mode (autoloads not registered), not a regression from these edits.

## Cross-Project Recurring Patterns (overall review 2026-06-28; fold-in 2026-07-03)
One root pattern across all ten KirkForge repos: the interesting problem gets finished, the boring plumbing gets deferred.
1. Release automation last/never — code ships to git, not users; .releaserc configured, no release.yml; versions drift.
2. Security features scaffolded, not completed — architecture built, last 10% deferred (Dopaflow ENCRYPTION_ENABLED stub; Plugin/PicoSentry signing without sandboxing; BIL approval 2/N actions; PetSense config.yaml never loaded; Packy rate-limiter missing one await).
3. CI is decorative — checks exist but non-blocking or wired to local scripts CI doesn't call (cargo audit continue-on-error; ci.sh vs GH Actions; `lint || true`).
4. Integration tests cut first — unit tests green; real e2e path untested / #[ignore] / unverified.
5. Ops docs lag code docs — ADRs/ARCHITECTURE.md strong; deployment guide / runbook / CHANGELOG / troubleshooting missing.
Applies to this repo:
1. Relevant — no deploy target in CI (gap 3 still open); HTML5 export verified in CI but never shipped anywhere.
2. Relevant — save encryption (gap 19) and cloud save (gap 20) deferred; PlayFab pending-queue persistence (gap 13) deferred.
3. Relevant — GDScript `--check-only` lint step skips because godot not installed in lint job (gap 9); Lighthouse step non-fatal (`|| echo "non-fatal"`).
4. Relevant — zero test coverage (gap 5); FS.syncfs persistence never verified end-to-end (gap 10).
5. Partially resolved — CHANGELOG.md and CONTRIBUTING.md now exist (gaps 16, 17); deploy/runbook/troubleshooting still missing.
